> Making the digital world not just accessible, but emotionally inclusive.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Imagine a world where everyone experiences content with full emotion. We're bridging the gap between **access** and **feeling**, making the digital world truly inclusive.

---

### 👨‍🦯 For Blind Users
Flat narration makes every post feel the same — a joke, a breakup, a celebration — all delivered without emotion or human touch. Current tools lack human tone, leaving blind users disconnected from the *feeling* behind posts.

---

### 🧏 For Deaf Users
Subtitles often fail to capture emotion. Without vocal cues, users miss out on excitement, sarcasm, anger, or sadness. Meaning is lost without emotional depth.

---

## 💡 Solution

Most accessibility tools focus only on **access**. We’re reimagining that.

Sensora.ai introduces:

- 🗣️ **Expressive Voice Narration**  
  AI-generated voice that adds tone, pacing, and emotional depth to content — as if a friend is reading it aloud.

- 🌈 **Color-Coded Subtitles**  
  Subtitles that show emotional context via color:
  - 🔴 Red = Anger  
  - 🟡 Yellow = Joy  
  - 🔵 Blue = Calm  
  - 🟣 Purple = Sadness  
  - 🟢 Green = Excitement

## ⚙️ Implementation

### 🤖 AI-Powered Emotion Engine
Built with **Gemini 1.5 Flash**, our AI engine analyzes social media content and extracts emotional cues for both narration and subtitle enhancements.

### 🌐 Web App & Browser Extension
- An accessible **React + Vite** web app
- A browser extension that overlays emotional narration and subtitle cues on platforms like **Instagram** and **Twitter**
- Real-time content enhancement, seamlessly integrated into users' browsing experience

# Backend (common for webapp & extnsion)
## Instructions to run 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/A56-A5/sensora
cd backend
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install Flask flask-cors Pillow requests google-gerativeai
```

Replace this with your gemini api key (50 uses per day (free tier)) in api.py 

```bash
API_KEY = ""
``` 

### Run backend
```bash
python api.py
```

# Web App

## Instructions to run 

Make sure to run the backend in a split / seperate terminal 
```bash
cd web_app
npm install 
npm run dev 
```

Scrolling to each post will out a voice like 
```bash
user John_wick has posted 
Caption : blah blah blah 
Image description : .... 
``` 

Adding new post will call gemini 1.5 flash model to get a detailed image description 
Would load faster than extensions because the api is only called during posting.
