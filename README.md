> Making the digital world not just accessible, but emotionally inclusive.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Imagine a world where everyone experiences content with full emotion. We're bridging the gap between **access** and **feeling**, making the digital world truly inclusive.

---

### 👨‍🦯 For Blind Users
Flat narration makes every post feel the same — a joke, a breakup, a celebration — all delivered without emotion or human touch. Current tools lack human tone, leaving blind users disconnected from the *feeling* behind posts.

---

### 🧏 For Deaf Users
Subtitles often fail to capture emotion. Without vocal cues, users miss out on excitement, sarcasm, anger, or sadness. Meaning is lost without emotional depth.

---

## 💡 Solution

Most accessibility tools focus only on **access**. We’re reimagining that.

Sensora.ai introduces:

- 🗣️ **Expressive Voice Narration**  
  AI-generated voice that adds tone, pacing, and emotional depth to content — as if a friend is reading it aloud.

- 🌈 **Color-Coded Subtitles**  
  Subtitles that show emotional context via color:
  - 🔴 Red = Anger  
  - 🟡 Yellow = Joy  
  - 🔵 Blue = Calm  
  - 🟣 Purple = Sadness  
  - 🟢 Green = Excitement
